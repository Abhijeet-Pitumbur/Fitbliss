# Fitbliss

It can be hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. Fitbliss is a fitness tracker application that has various features to help its users manage their health. It helps its users know how much physical activity they need, keep track of their daily exercises, and shows them how many calories they are burning.

Users have to create an account to use the application. The user’s information is stored in a MySQL database. This information (height, weight, year of birth, gender) is used to calculate the recommended amount of calories they need to burn daily. They are able to add exercises done during their day, and a pie chart is used to show this daily activity. They can also view their entire history of exercises done.
